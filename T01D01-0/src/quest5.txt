1) I opened the directory with door configarations via command below:
cd T01D01-0/src/door_management_files/door_configuration/

2) Then, I opened the file "door_1.conf" through Vim text editor via next command:
vim door_1.conf

3) Then I entered "i" to access the "INSERT MODE".

4) By using cursor keys I moved the cursor to the "CLOSED", specifically I pressed next cursor keys:
3 times down, 14 times right

5) After it I deleted the word "CLOSED" by using "backspace" button 6 times.

5) The next step was to enter the word "OPEN". First of all I switched on "CAPS LOCK" mode to enter upper-case keys. Then by using "o", "p", "e" and "n" buttons I required word "OPEN"

6) After it by pressing "Escape" button I exited the "INSERT: mode.

7) The final step was "Save and exit" current file, espesially "door_1.conf". This was happened via entering the next command:
:qw

8) Congratulations! The file edited and saved successfully.
